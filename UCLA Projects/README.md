# UCLA Projects

This folder contains some of the larger projects I did for various CS courses.  Starter code, the spec, and my own work can be found here.  **I am not the author of said specs and starter code.**  

### Disclaimer
Also, please note that this section is specifically for me to showcase my work; it is not to help others in the class finish their projects faster.  **Please remember that plagiarism is not acceptable!**

**Professors and other instructors:**
If you taught the class I uploaded starter code for, and would like it taken down, send me an email at adnjan2011@gmail.com and I will do so as soon as I am able.
