I primarily code in Python and Java, but am also proficient in C, C++, JS.  I am interested in all things algorithms and computer theory.  Some of my favorite topics are artificial intelligence structures and methods, cryptography, and quantum computing.  Despite this, my interests are not pure computer science, but rather, the applications of computers on learning about the world.  This includes the study of molecules, organisms, and far-away objects in outer space, but also political climate, the stock and crypto markets, and even fictional worlds, such as the game mechanics of Minecraft.  Other technical skills I have include document formatting (LaTeX), data analysis, computer aided design, and 3D modeling.
